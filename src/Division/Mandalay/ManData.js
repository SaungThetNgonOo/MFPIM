            paragraph:`If you’re in Mandalay, make it a point to visit Mount Popa. It’s one
             of the best Myanmar points of interest especially if you love to hike. The 
             extinct volcano is not just magnificent to look at in itself but it’s topped 
             by the Popa Taungkalat Monastery that’s perched on an outcrop. 777 steps will 
             take you all the way to the top and reward you with panoramic views of the 
             plains.
             Mount Popa is a mountain near Bagan that towers over the region below. This is 
             considered to be the Mount Olympus of Myanmar and is a very holy place. Locals 
             believe that Nat Spirits live here and several shrines and pavilions honour 
             them. People come from all around the country to make their offerings to 
             appease these potentially nasty spirits.
            When you arrive, it’s free to climb up the 777 steps to reach the top. Several 
            vendors sell their goods and you’re sharing the mountain with an army of 
            monkeys. At the top, there’s a large pagoda and beautiful views of the dry, 
            dusty landscape below. The best way to reach Mount Popa is to take a tour from 
            Bagan.
            An ancient extinct volcano, Mount Popa is amongst the most religious tourist 
            attractions in Myanmar. It is home to 37 temples dedicated to Mahagiri Nat 
            spirits and a sacred pilgrimage place for the Burmese. Taung Kalat is the most 
            famous shrine amongst the 37 temples and is dedicated to Goddess Popa.
            To reach this shrine one has to climb about 777 steps but the architectural 
            marvels and panoramic views of the surroundings are worth every effort.`,

            places in Myanmar. Over 2,000 Buddhist monuments dot the Bagan Archeological 
            Zone that’s spread across 26 square miles. The best way to take in the entirety 
            of this breathtaking city is to hop into a hot air balloon and fly over it. The 
            rides take place in the wee hours of the morning. Carry a good camera so you can
             take photos of the monuments from above.
             Travelers with a passion for Buddhist temples, pagodas and stupas should have 
             a field day in Bagan, since it contains more of these than any other place in 
             the world. The most popular destination in Myanmar, Bagan was the capital of 
             the First Burmese Empire from the 9th to the 13th centuries. The site that 
             Marco Polo once described as the “gilded city” was home to around Buddhist 
             13,000 temples in its 11th-century heyday. Thousands of temples, stupas and 
             pagodas remain, including the famous Ananda temple with its sparkling gold 
             spires.
             Bagan is the number one attraction in Myanmar – and for good reason – you 
             simply cannot skip it! Home to over 2,000 enchanting stupas spread across the 
             endless countryside, it’s a true feast for the eyes. The best part about Bagan 
             is that, unlike other archaeological sites like it, it’s still fairly untouched 
             by tourists. But it’s catching on, so don’t leave it too long!
            The best way to experience the utter magic of Bagan is by taking a hot air 
            balloon ride at sunrise. There are so many stupas you simply cannot appreciate 
            them all from ground level.
            Pagodas aside, you can explore one of Baga’s local markets – such as the Mani 
            Sithu Market, cycle past the temples on a bike or e-bike, and shop for high-
            quality lacquer products. And if it’s a foodie experience you’re after, you 
            won’t be disappointed in Bagan; you’ll find no shortage of Asian cuisine here
             – not just Burmese but Chinese, Thai, Indian, and even Tibetan, so come 
             hungry!
             The Kingdom of Bagan was an ancient Kingdom responsible for building temples 
             between the 11th and 13th century. In fact, this early civilisation constructed
              no less than 10,000 temples, monasteries, and pagodas within the relatively 
              small area of Bagan. This is by far one of the best Myanmar tourist 
              attractions and is one of the most visited places in the country.
            You can rent an e-bike for a very reasonable price and explore the ruinous 
            temples independently. Some are larger and in better conditions, whereas others 
            are barely standing after centuries of exposure to the elements. Watching the 
            sunrise or sunset over these ancient temples is a highlight for any tourist. If 
            you’re not travelling on a budget, you can take a hot air balloon ride to gaze 
            down at the temples and landscape below.
            Tourists have to pay an entrance fee of MKK 25000 ($20) to enter the 
            archaeological zone of Old Bagan. You have to buy this before leaving Nyaung U 
            Airport near Bagan or the bus will take you to a ticket office before you enter 
            the town.`,

            the world. The lake is a great place to see the sunrise or sunset. You can also

             Amarapura meaning “City of Immortality” is a city in the Mandalay Division of 
             Myanmar, situated 11 km to the south of Mandalay. The locals sometimes refer 
             to it as Taungmyo (Southern City) to distinguish it from Mandalay (Northern 
            City).
            King Bodawpaya (1781-1819) of the Konbaung Dynasty founded Amarapura to be his 
            new capital in 1783, soon after he ascended the throne. In 1795, he received 
            the first British embassy to visit Burma. Bodawpaya’s son, King Bagyidaw (1819-
            1837), moved the Court back to Inwa in 1823.
            From 1841-1857, King Mindon Min (1853-1878) decided to make Amarapura the 
            capital again, before relocating to his planned city of Mandalay in 1860. Today,
             little remains of the old city, as the palace buildings were dismantled and 
             move by elephant to the new location, and the city walls were pulled down for 
             use as building materials for roads and railways.
            The city is known today for silk and cotton weaving, and bronze casting. It is 
            a popular tourist day-trip from Mandalay.`,
