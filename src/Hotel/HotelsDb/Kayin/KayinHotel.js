    your own apartment. Spotlessly clean with everything thought of to make if feel like a home. Clothes rack, 
    coffee, great shower. Decor is wonderful. The man who runs the place is incredible, so helpful and kind. They 
    have delish dinners available but ask in advance. It’s about 10 mins from the town by scooter, but this is the 
    perfect place to chill in a rural setting with fantastic WiFi. Can’t recommend this place enough.`,
