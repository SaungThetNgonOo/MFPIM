            to when visiting the country. But these little known gems are incredibly 
            picturesque and have all the hallmarks of great beaches. Palm trees, blue seas 
            and pale sands offer the perfect place to spend lazy days soaking in the sun. 
            Ngwe Saug or Silver Beach is one of the most popular. There are scuba diving 
            and snorkeling facilities too if you want to explore the water. Cafes and 
            restaurants nearby serve up dish after dish of lip-smacking seafood and snacks.
            Beaches in Myanmar are best visited during December-April when spring lends 
            itself to deliciously warm weather. You can also catch the Water Festival 
            (Thingyan) in April where everyone comes out to celebrate.
            Ngwe Saung is an upmarket beach resort with a seemingly endless stretch of 
            silvery coastline on the Bay of Bengal. More sophisticated than popular Chaung 
            Tha Beach, Ngwe Saung is the sought-after destination for Yangon’s rich and 
            famous.
            Offering that get-away-from-it-all experience with beautiful white sand and 
            brilliant blue ocean edged by palm trees, Ngwe Saung is simply paradise. 
            Indulge in the slow life and do as much or as little as you like – both are 
            encouraged here.
            Take a leisurely stroll across the sandbar to Lover’s Island at low tide, 
            admire the beachfront pagodas, go snorkeling at Bird Island, and indulge in a 
            fresh seafood dinner at sunset. Don’t miss the fire dancing shows at Ume café 
            every evening for your daily dose of vibrant Burmese culture!`,

            "paragraph":`Chaung Thar Beach Myanmar is one of the popular beaches in Myanmar. 
            Located just 6 hours drive from Yangon. An alternative route is an overnight 
            steamer trip from Yangon, along Twante canal up to Pathein and then a one and a 
            half hour drive by coach to Chaung Thar Beach. This beach is also very popular 
            and famous beach in Myanmar. The highway to Chaung Thar is through the mountain 
            ranges, going up and down. But as soon as you arrive to the plain, then you will
             be very pleased with the sea view.
            Chaung Thar is a little muddy compared to Ngwe Saung, but there are a lot of 
            other advantages. You can have plenty of sea food with very reasonable prices, 
            all the hotels are in a row, next to each other. The room rates are also very 
            fair too.`,
