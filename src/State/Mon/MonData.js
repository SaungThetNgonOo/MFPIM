                Mawlamyine can be quite a good change in those terms. It provides you with 
                a break from the same and does contribute to your city demands. It is 
                situated in the deep territory of Mon, very close to the borders of 
                Thailand and is known and appreciated around for its amazing cultural 
                forefront. Apart from the hustling of the city, you can also visit the 
                pagodas like that of the Mahamuni Paya which is famous for its 
                architectural creativities. Apart from that, you can also visit the 
                Uzina Paya stupa which is one of the most popular sites for the pilgrims. 
                If possible, charter a boat and visit the mysterious Shampoo Island t get 
                to know the place even better and witness the Buddhist shrines with your 
                own eyes.`,

            paragraph:`It may be small but Kyaiktiyo Pagoda or Golden Rock in Mon State is one of the most 
            striking pagodas because of its location. It’s perched on a boulder that’s covered with gold 
            leaves. The boulder itself seems to defy gravity as it perfectly balances itself on another 
            rock atop Mt. Kyaiktiyo. It’s believed that the boulder remains in its unusual position 
            by virtue of the hair relic enshrined in the pagoda. And, legend has it that the boulder
             is supported by a strand of hair from Buddha. Whatever the reason, the unusual and 
             dramatic attraction makes it one of the most sought-after Myanmar places to visit. 
             You can get to the pagoda by bus but if you want to get up close with nature, you can 
             hike the 16-kilometer trail. As tiring as it can be, you won’t be alone as pilgrims 
             often choose to walk to the top.
             Golden Rock, also locally referred to as Kyaiktiyo Zedi is a truly awesome 
             sight. It is a pagoda (zedi) that sits atop a huge rock that appears as if 
             it’s about to fall from the edge of the cliff. The pagoda and rock, both are 
             covered with golf leaf. The locals believe that the rock that is situated 
             1,100 meters above sea level is held at this place through a miracle of Buddha.
              Moreover, the pagoda is said to have a strand of Buddha’s hair. It is a 
            pilgrimage for Myanmar Buddhists. Golden Rock is located around a five-hour 
            drive from Yangon and also, includes a long walk. A staircase leads to the  
            pagoda complex that houses various viewing platforms and Buddha shrines.

            sight: a pagoda (zedi) sitting atop a huge boulder that appears as if it’s 
            about to fall off the edge of a cliff. Both are covered in golf leaf. The 
            locals believe the boulder, which sits 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) above sea 
            level, is held in place through a miracle of Buddha; the pagoda is said to 
            contain a strand of his hair. Visiting here is a pilgrimage for Myanmar 
            Buddhists. Golden Rock is about a five-hour drive from Yangon, and also 
            involves a long walk. A staircase leads to the pagoda complex that houses 
            several viewing platforms and Buddha shrines.
            You simply cannot visit Myanmar without planning a trip to Mount Kyaiktiyo, 
            home to the famous golden rock and gilded pagoda – one of the most sacred sites
             in the country and a popular pilgrimage spot.
            This enormous golden rock teeters precariously on the edge of a cliff and is 
            said to be held in place by the hair of Buddha. While this boulder is surely 
            the main attraction, you should also see the Shwedagon Pagoda and the Mahamuni 
            Temple while you’re here.
            Not to mention the enchanting views of the Mon State mountains you’ll enjoy 
            from the top of the mountain! You can reach Kyaiktiyo by taking an open-top 
            truck and cable car or by challenging yourself to the four-hour hike to the top.
             Bear in mind that while you can pay to place a gold leaf onto the rock, this 
             is strictly limited to men only.  `,
