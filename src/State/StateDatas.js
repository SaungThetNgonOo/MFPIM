            leaves. The boulder itself seems to defy gravity as it perfectly balances itself on another 
            rock atop Mt. Kyaiktiyo. It’s believed that the boulder remains in its unusual position 
            by virtue of the hair relic enshrined in the pagoda. And, legend has it that the boulder
             is supported by a strand of hair from Buddha. Whatever the reason, the unusual and 
             dramatic attraction makes it one of the most sought-after Myanmar places to visit. 
             You can get to the pagoda by bus but if you want to get up close with nature, you can 
             hike the 16-kilometer trail. As tiring as it can be, you won’t be alone as pilgrims 
             often choose to walk to the top.
             Golden Rock, also locally referred to as Kyaiktiyo Zedi is a truly awesome

             covered with golf leaf. The locals believe that the rock that is situated

              Moreover, the pagoda is said to have a strand of Buddha’s hair. It is a 
            pilgrimage for Myanmar Buddhists. Golden Rock is located around a five-hour

            This enormous golden rock teeters precariously on the edge of a cliff and is 
            said to be held in place by the hair of Buddha. While this boulder is surely 
            the main attraction, you should also see the Shwedagon Pagoda and the Mahamuni 
            Temple while you’re here.
            Not to mention the enchanting views of the Mon State mountains you’ll enjoy 
            from the top of the mountain! You can reach Kyaiktiyo by taking an open-top 
            truck and cable car or by challenging yourself to the four-hour hike to the top.
             Bear in mind that while you can pay to place a gold leaf onto the rock, this

            fortress because of the thick walls, but the walls were made to protect temples 
            from the fierce winds, not invaders. Stone temples can be found throughout the 
            area. The medieval town was once an important Arakan capital and was an 
            important trading city. Getting to this remote location involves a four- to 
            seven-hour boat ride up a tributary of the Kaladan River. Travelers may want

            Mrauk U – once known as Mrohaung – is an abandoned city with strong 
            archaeological importance. While its temples are similar to Bagan’s, they’re 
            smaller and a lot more modern – made from stone instead of brick.
            Surrounded by still-inhabited rural villages, rice paddies, and a panorama of 
            rolling countryside, these temple ruins which were once part of a powerful 
            Arakan kingdom are a sight to behold.
            While Mrauk U was a thriving trading post during the First Anglo-Burmese War, 
            it was relocated to Sittwe after the war ended, leaving Mrauk U behind. Since 
            then, the temples and the city itself have been largely forgotten, left to 
            crumble into dust. The isolation is what makes Mrauk U charming though; only 
            5,000 tourists make it here every year – so you’re likely to get the temples 
            pretty much all to yourself.`

            paragraph:`Next on our list of what to see in Myanmar is Inle Lake, which is 
            the second largest in the country and occupies one of the highest elevations. 
            It’s located in Shan and is home to numerous endemic species of snails and fish.
             Unfortunately, their numbers have dwindled but that should not be a deterrent. 
             Stilt houses pepper the waterway and the only way to see them is by boat. As 
             you head towards the village of In Dein, you’ll be greeted by two groups of 
             old pagodas, the Shwe Indein pagodas and Nyaung Ohak pagodas. Some are in 
             ruins while others have been restored.
             Inle Lake is a freshwater lake in the Taunggyi District of Shan State, which is
             part of Shan Hills in Myanmar. With an expected surface area of 116 km, it is 
             the second largest lake of the country. The lake is located at an elevation of 
             2,900 feet. There is a hot water spring on the northwestern shore of the lake.
              The lake is not that large but it is home to a number of widespread species. 
              More than 20 species of snails and 9 species of fish are in this lake that 
              nowhere else are found in the world.
              Vast and serene Inle Lake is one of the top tourist attractions in Myanmar. 
              Besides its considerable natural beauty the lake also attracts tourists for 
              the stilt houses of the Intha, the descendants of Mon people from the far 
              southeast. A typical day-trip on the lake, taken in a long, narrow boat with 
              a noisy outboard motor, will stick to the northern reaches of Inle Lake. 
              These trips also include visits to small workshops in stilt villages, several 
              pagodas and probably a market. Travelers are also likely to see fishermen 
              propelling their boats using a distinctive leg-rowing technique, and other 
              Intha residents of the lake tending to fruit and vegetables on floating 
              gardens.
              The Lake Inle region is a picturesque place famous for its unusual floating 
              villages, pretty gardens, and glorious temples. As there are no roads here, 
              you’ll get around by wooden boat.
                Staying in Lake Inle is a great way to immerse yourself entirely in local 
                life on the lake. Stay in over-water villas located on stilts above the 
                water, explore thousand-year-old pagodas, and see over 200 monasteries 
                scattered around the lake – don’t miss the Jumping Cat Monastery!
            Other attractions worth visiting in Lake Inle include the floating market at 
            Ywama village and the gorgeous floating gardens of Nampan village. A 
            traditional cooking class at Mr. Toe’s restaurant is a great way to bring a 
            piece of Myanmar home with you.
            Inle Lake is certainly one of the most stunning places to visit in Myanmar for 
            its blue water and majestic hills in the backdrop. It is the second-largest 
            freshwater lake in Myanmar and spread over forty-five square miles. 
            The lake is a great place to witness the beautiful floating gardens, a wide 
            range of flora and fauna, and spectacular sunset scenery. Take a private boat 
            or shared boat to enjoy a thrilling sail through the waters and collect 
            beautiful memories and pictures or buy a locally made product to take back as a 
            souvenir.`

             most of the pagodas are similar in shape and size, the central pagoda is 40 m 
            high.   
            Most pagodas are made from bricks and coated with stucco and still have the
