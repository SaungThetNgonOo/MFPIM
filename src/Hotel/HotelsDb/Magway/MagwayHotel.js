        very good English so he helped me with all the possible questions I had about the place, the E-bike rent, 
        literally everything. All the stuff was very helpful and friendly. When I had a problem with booking a taxi from 
        my next hotel, the stuff helped me to communicate with the stuff of that hotel that didn't speak any English. 
        They handled my laundry with care and all the things were in perfect condition. Very good breakfast.`,
