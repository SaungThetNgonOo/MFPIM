            paragraph:`Next on our list of what to see in Myanmar is Inle Lake, which is 
            the second largest in the country and occupies one of the highest elevations. 
            It’s located in Shan and is home to numerous endemic species of snails and fish.
             Unfortunately, their numbers have dwindled but that should not be a deterrent. 
             Stilt houses pepper the waterway and the only way to see them is by boat. As 
             you head towards the village of In Dein, you’ll be greeted by two groups of 
             old pagodas, the Shwe Indein pagodas and Nyaung Ohak pagodas. Some are in 
             ruins while others have been restored.
             Inle Lake is a freshwater lake in the Taunggyi District of Shan State, which is
             part of Shan Hills in Myanmar. With an expected surface area of 116 km, it is 
             the second largest lake of the country. The lake is located at an elevation of 
             2,900 feet. There is a hot water spring on the northwestern shore of the lake.
              The lake is not that large but it is home to a number of widespread species. 
              More than 20 species of snails and 9 species of fish are in this lake that 
              nowhere else are found in the world.
              Vast and serene Inle Lake is one of the top tourist attractions in Myanmar. 
              Besides its considerable natural beauty the lake also attracts tourists for 
              the stilt houses of the Intha, the descendants of Mon people from the far 
              southeast. A typical day-trip on the lake, taken in a long, narrow boat with 
              a noisy outboard motor, will stick to the northern reaches of Inle Lake. 
              These trips also include visits to small workshops in stilt villages, several 
              pagodas and probably a market. Travelers are also likely to see fishermen 
              propelling their boats using a distinctive leg-rowing technique, and other 
              Intha residents of the lake tending to fruit and vegetables on floating 
              gardens.
              The Lake Inle region is a picturesque place famous for its unusual floating 
              villages, pretty gardens, and glorious temples. As there are no roads here, 
              you’ll get around by wooden boat.
                Staying in Lake Inle is a great way to immerse yourself entirely in local 
                life on the lake. Stay in over-water villas located on stilts above the 
                water, explore thousand-year-old pagodas, and see over 200 monasteries 
                scattered around the lake – don’t miss the Jumping Cat Monastery!
            Other attractions worth visiting in Lake Inle include the floating market at 
            Ywama village and the gorgeous floating gardens of Nampan village. A 
            traditional cooking class at Mr. Toe’s restaurant is a great way to bring a 
            piece of Myanmar home with you.
            Inle Lake is certainly one of the most stunning places to visit in Myanmar for 
            its blue water and majestic hills in the backdrop. It is the second-largest 
            freshwater lake in Myanmar and spread over forty-five square miles. 
            The lake is a great place to witness the beautiful floating gardens, a wide 
            range of flora and fauna, and spectacular sunset scenery. Take a private boat 
            or shared boat to enjoy a thrilling sail through the waters and collect 
            beautiful memories and pictures or buy a locally made product to take back as a 
            souvenir.`,

             most of the pagodas are similar in shape and size, the central pagoda is 40 m 
            high.   
            Most pagodas are made from bricks and coated with stucco and still have the 
            hti. Many stupas are decorated with carved sculptures while some have enshrined 
            images of the Buddha. Do plan a visit to this unique place and have a memorable
