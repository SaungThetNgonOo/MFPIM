            paragraph:`Yet another of the must visits around in Myanmar is Ngapali. This is 
            possibly the most popular sand stretch around in Myanmar and does make up for one 
            of the most popular relaxing spots in the entirety of Myanmar. The combination of 
            the yellow-white sand is what makes it one of the most beautiful spots that you 
            can sit and tan yourself and let loose of the thoughts that do intrigue you. It 
            is located around the Bay of Bengal, the vibrant hues of the blue of the waves 
            adding to the beauty of the place even further. The salt washed boats often come 
            ashore, in and out of the bay, making it one of the most amazing spots to enjoy 
            the freshly caught seafood in. Apart from the relaxing experience, you can also 
            sign up with a tour organizer around the place and get into some of the most 
            popular water sports like scuba diving, jet skiing, sea kayaking and the whole 
            lot.
            Ngapali Beach is a popular beach destination of Myanmar. With its immaculate, 
            palm-fringed white sand, the crystal clear waters of the Bay of Bengal, and a 
            number of stylish accommodation options, it turns into a major beach holiday 
            destination. It maintains a laid-back fishing village aura and treats the 
            guests with warm hospitality as the locals of this place are really good at 
            heart.
            Ngapali combines two worlds in this Southeast Asian country. It is Myanmar’s 
            premier resort town, with white sand beaches lining the blue waters of the Bay 
            of Bengal and luxury hotels. It is a great spot to chill out and just relax. 
            Contrast this with its fishing village atmosphere with local restaurants 
            serving the day’s catch and ox-carts doubling as taxis. Locals believe the 
            town is named after Napoli (Naples) in Italy. Most people visit Ngapali 
            November to March; the rest of the year it is a sleepy little beach town.
            Ngapali is the most popular beach destination in Myanmar. Located on the 
            spectacular Bay of Bengal, this stretch of coastline boasts a total of three 
            bays dotted with fishing villages, beaches, and coconut palm. It’s all about 
            the slow life here in Ngapalai – swim, sunbathe, sleep, repeat.
            When you’ve had your fair share of relaxation, you can go fishing, kayaking, 
            snorkeling, or scuba diving to see the exotic fish in the bay. Back on land, 
            there are golf courses, fishing villages, and seafood restaurants to discover 
            on foot, by bicycle, or motorbike.
            Or you can simply relax and indulge in the beach happy hour specials. Don’t 
            miss the chance to climb or drive up to Tilawkasayambhu Buddha at the top of 
            the hill – it offers the most exceptional views over the bay!
            Discover one of the most serene beaches in Asia with a trip to the stunning 
            Ngapali Beach and be mesmerized with turquoise blue water, white soft sand, 
            and the sea scenery of your dream. Located approximately 400 km Northwest of 
            Yangon, this beach is indeed a picture-perfect paradise on the Bay of Bengal to

            The beach offers a beautiful setting to just sit and relax and a range of water 
            sports and activities like scuba diving, snorkeling, boating, fishing, etc.

            paragraph:`Yet another one of the picturesque and popular sites of attraction 
            around in Myanmar is the off the beaten track destination of Mrauk U. It is 
            often considered as one of the best alternatives to visiting Bagan because of 
            the kind of similarities both of these places inflict on the geography of 
            Myanmar. It is located between the majestic hills of the Rakhine State, in the 
            far western reaches of the country. The place is rich of a wide range of stupas 
            and temples which is what makes up for the primary source of attraction in that 
            specific tourist site. You must also visit the age-old Arakanese religious 
            building which is situated there. It grew to become a popular site of being a 
            powerful merchant center during the late Middle Ages, trading between India, 
            Portugal and several other places.
            Mrauk U is an important archeological town. It was originally thought to be a 
            fortress because of the thick walls, but the walls were made to protect temples 
            from the fierce winds, not invaders. Stone temples can be found throughout the 
            area. The medieval town was once an important Arakan capital and was an 
            important trading city. Getting to this remote location involves a four- to 
            seven-hour boat ride up a tributary of the Kaladan River. Travelers may want 
            to bring rain gear at the region gets almost 1.2 meter (4 feet) of rain 
            annually.
            Mrauk U – once known as Mrohaung – is an abandoned city with strong 
            archaeological importance. While its temples are similar to Bagan’s, they’re 
            smaller and a lot more modern – made from stone instead of brick.
            Surrounded by still-inhabited rural villages, rice paddies, and a panorama of 
            rolling countryside, these temple ruins which were once part of a powerful 
            Arakan kingdom are a sight to behold.
            While Mrauk U was a thriving trading post during the First Anglo-Burmese War, 
            it was relocated to Sittwe after the war ended, leaving Mrauk U behind. Since 
            then, the temples and the city itself have been largely forgotten, left to 
            crumble into dust. The isolation is what makes Mrauk U charming though; only 
            5,000 tourists make it here every year – so you’re likely to get the temples 
            pretty much all to yourself.`,

            small hill in the Mrauk U town and houses a long spiraling corridor heading to 
            the inner chamber.
            The temple was built on a raised ground and has small windows and just a single 
            entrance. The structure is surrounded by massive stone walls and as per the 
            legends, it served as the place of refuge during times of war`,
