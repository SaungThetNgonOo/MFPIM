            The Shwethalyaung Buddha is one of the largest reclining Buddha images in Burma.
             It is housed in the Shwethalyaung Paya in Bago, an important pilgrimage site 
             for Buddhists who come here to pay homage to the Buddha.
            The image measuring 55 meters long and 16 meters high depicts the Buddha just 
            before death and entering into Nirvana.
            The reclining Buddha image is housed in an iron pavilion called tazaung with 
            Italian marble on the floor. On the walls are murals depicting scenes from the 
            Jataka tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha.
            On a large pedestal rests a white image of the Buddha with a serene smile 
            wearing a gilded robe, the head resting on a “pillow” of caskets inlaid with 
            mosaics. The soles of the feet are decorated with images representing the 108 
            lakshanas or auspicious characteristics of the Buddha. Around the Buddha are 
            several guardian Nats, spirits that have been worshipped in Burma for many 
            centuries.`,
