            (103km) north-west of Mandalay on the eastern bank of the Chindwin River. Shwebo
             was the native town of King Alaungpaya, the founder of the Kone Baung Dynasty. 
             Shwebo was royal capital of Myanmar from 1760-1764. King Alaungpaya fought 
             against the rule of the Mon Monarchy in 1752, and his dynasty lasted over two 
             centuries. He used the city as a base from which to conquer Innwa and Lower 
             Myanmar, establishing the Third Myanmar Empire. His successor, King Hsinbyushin,
              moved the capital to Amarapura in the 1780s, and the city has been in decline 
              ever since. Shwebo is also called in five different names. Moksobo, its 
              original name Yadana-Theinhka, Konbaung, Yangyi-Aung and Shwebo, its modern 
              name.
            As with Monywa, the city is a trade center for agricultural produce, especially 
            beans, rice and sesame from the surrounding plains between the Mu and the 
            Ayeyarwady River. The area around Shwebo was the site of the anient Pyu city
            -state of Hanlin.`,
