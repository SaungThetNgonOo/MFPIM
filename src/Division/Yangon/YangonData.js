            gilded Shwedagon Pagoda. It’s considered to be one of the most sacred pagodas

            4,500 diamonds encrusting the top of the stupa, it’s an architectural wonder 
            that will take your breath away. If there’s only one pagoda you can visit during

             related to Buddhism in Myanmar as it contains a strand of Buddha’s hair and 
             other religious relics. This 2,500-year-old pagoda is sited on Singuttara 
             Hill in Yangon. Over the centuries, this pagoda has grown from 8 meters to 
             99 meters. It is believed that Shwedagon pagoda is believed to be built by 
             the Mon during the Bagan period between the 6th and 10th century AD. This 
             pagoda is covered in gold leaf; this stupa is covered in 4, 531 diamonds. 
             The visitors of pagoda are expected to follow a dress code (preferably trousers
